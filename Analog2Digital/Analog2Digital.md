# Analog To Digital

The IceCore STM32 has triple 2.5MSPS ADCs (interleaved to 7.2MSPS).

These will be available on the middle pins of the 3 MixMods, when the firmware has been updated 

In the meantime there are various ADC devices that can be used, such as the Digilent 2-channel 12-bit [PmodAD1](https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-ad1-two-12-bit-a-d-inputs/).

And the 8-bit [Flashy device](https://www.knjn.com/Flashy.html) with a suitable Pmod.
