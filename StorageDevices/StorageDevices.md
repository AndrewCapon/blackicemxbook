## SD Cards

There is a built-in SD card reader on the BlackIce Mx that can be accessed from the Ice40.

Use of the SD card really requires a CPU as the combination of commands required is very difficult to do withut one.

Several of the retro computer implementations use SD cards, including the Arorn Atom one, which uses a custom format for the card, SDDOS.

The SD card can be read and written using a Risc-V SoC, such as SaxonSoC or PiocoSoC.
