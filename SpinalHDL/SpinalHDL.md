# Spinal HDL

SpinalHDL is an alternative Hardware Description Language (HDL). It is Domain Specific Language (DSL) based on the Scala language, and is much more powerful for generating hardware than Verilog.

I will show how it can be used on Blackice Mx to generate the same examples that were implemented in Verilog.

## Installation

Scala is a Java VM based language, so needs Java installed. It has a build system called SBT (Scala Build Tool) which allows Scala program to be compiled and executed from the command line, so that too must be installed.

The installation instructions are in the [SpinalTemplateSBt] project.
